# Python Calculator

## Function

This python calculator is one of the best ones to ever be generated by any member of this species. Meticulous effort was put into it to ensure that the user experience is top notch, the outputs given precise, and the code unambiguous and error-free.

## Usage

To use, simply download the `main.py` file. After doing so, you can just cd into the directory it was downloaded in, and simply type `python main.py` to begin using the calculator.

## Todo

- Make the calculator sentient
- Create world peace using calculator-oriented tactics
- Perhaps add a GUI of some sort

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python coding language, as well as Gaius Lucilius, who is believed to be the inventor of satire.
