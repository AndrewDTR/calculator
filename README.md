# üêç Python Calculator üßÆ

## Function

After being forced to solve complex math equations on paper and in my head, I thought to myself *"there must be a better way".* Well, now there is! I've created the world's first calculator, which will allow you to solve math equations simply by inputting two numbers as well as an operator into a terminal. In mere seconds, it will return an answer to you with the speed of light! No more pencil sharpening required -- this 100% virtual calculator has got you covered!

## Usage

To use, simply download the `cli.py` file. After doing so, you can just cd into the directory it was downloaded in, and simply type `python main.py` to begin using the calculator.

## Todo

- Make the calculator sentient
- Create world peace using calculator-oriented tactics
- Perhaps add a GUI of some sort

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python coding language.
